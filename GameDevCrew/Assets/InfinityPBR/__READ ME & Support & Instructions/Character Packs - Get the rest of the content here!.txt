The Monster and Character Packs are bundles of other assets from the Asset Store. Unfortunately the store treats them as separate items entirely, so buying "RPG Character Pack #2" will give you access to that download, but not the three packages that make up the bundle.

The following Character & Monster Packs have the rest of their content available at http://www.InfinityPBR.com -- you will need to register your asset store purchase and create an account on my site. I know that sucks, but the Asset Store won't allow the following packs to be fully uploaded, as the size (mostly due to the 4k textures) is too large.

Once registered, you'll find .unitypackage files on the "Downloads" page of my site. Thanks for understanding!
